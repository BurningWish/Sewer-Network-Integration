# Sewer Network Integration Algorithm

This repository contains the code to generate fine scale sewer network for the central area Newcastle upon Tyne. Due to data sensitivity, the sewer main network (from CityCAT project) is not provided here. Run the script `0 - Preprocessing Data.py`, and `1 - Main Script.py` sequentially to generate the result.
